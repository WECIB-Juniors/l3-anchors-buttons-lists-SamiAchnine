    <p>I want to introduce myself but you, (yes you, Mr. Gardner) already know some things about me pretty well. <br> I only really want to have some text here so that it makes sense for the assignment, because I am really tired today. <br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio doloremque fugit ea soluta voluptates cum dolores harum numquam nobis adipisci, totam iusto suscipit aliquid, placeat quod eligendi illum obcaecati est? I agree with this because ow ow ow my hands hurt ow owwieeee this keyboard hurts!<br> I feel like I need to MASH the HECK out of each and every key as HARD as possible just to get something to type. I hate these keyboards. That's all you need to know about me.</p>
